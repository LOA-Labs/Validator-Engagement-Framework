This public repo outlines the [LOA Labs](https://loalabs.io) Validator Engagement Framework

Validators are key contributors to blockchain protocols and must perform to high levels of standards to help achieve the success of the network. 

A highly valued validator does more than just meet the technical requirements of node operation; a blockchain is also a community, a business enterprise, a public service, a scientific experiment, a social experiment, and a platform for innovation. 

The engagement outline below covers the multiple types of services that LOA Labs provides as a validator and active member of the community. 

This public repo outlines how LOA Labs validator engages with each chain and logs goods and services delivered. Meeting all of these metrics is the objective, however service and availability may be subject to variation due to technical limitations of some blockchains and/or community governance. 

This repo is itself a delivered good open to use by the community for tracking deliverables. It logs contributions, public goods and services delivered. This repo is itself a delivered good open for use by the community for tracking and publicizing their own deliverables. Fork it.
