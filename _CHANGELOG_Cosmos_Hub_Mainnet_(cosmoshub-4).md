# Cosmos Hub Mainnet (cosmoshub-4)

Mainnet for the Internet of Blockchains. The Cosmos Hub is the premier blockchain in the cosmos ecosystem of zones, interconnected by IBC technology, which very well may be the next TCP/IP. 

LOA Labs runs a full-service, bare-metal, off-shore validator operations plan for the Cosmos Hub, bringing the highest level and priority in uptime, community support, governance, and innovation in the space, especially related to Regenerative Finance, Public Goods, and Conflict Resolution opportunities to uplift and increase chances of success for the Internet of Blockchains. 

LOA Labs will position itself within The Hub as the primary instigator, collaborator and mover for all things ReFi and Public Goods, leveraging its connections in the Cosmos Zones (with a strong emphases on connections with Regen Network) and exterior ecosystems as well.
